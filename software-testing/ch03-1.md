> Overview-Logic Predicates and Clauses

#### Q: What is predicate and clause?
A predicate is an expression that evaluates to true or false. It is the topmost structure.
A predicate consists of:
- variables (can be boolean or non-boolean)
- function calls (return boolean or non-boolean values)
- comparator operator (including {=,!=,>,<,>=,<=})
- logical operator (including {and, or, not, xor, →, ⇔})
- parenthesis

A clause is a predicate which does not contain any logical operator.

Note:
- operators have precedence
- a predicate may be written in many equivalent forms using rules in boolean algebra
- short circuit versions of `and` and `or` are useful when evaluating predicate

#### Q: Why are predicate and clause important?
Because they constitute logic expressions.  
Logic expressions are used widely in most softwares.  
Logic expressions can be tested via logic coverage criteria.

#### Q: Why logic coverage criteria are important?
**Evidence**: FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) accepted them (e.g., MDCC).

#### Q: When to use predicate and clause?
When we want to express logical expressions **precisely** (translated from natural language).

#### Q: Where to find predicate and clause in software artifacts?
- code (e.g., if-elss)
- specification (e.g, precondition)
- finite state machine (e.g., triggering condition for transition)
