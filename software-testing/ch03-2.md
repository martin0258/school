## 3. Logic Testing 
### 3.2 Logic Expression Coverage Criteria 

### Question
#### Q: What are the development of logic coverage criteria?
1. Predicate Coverage (predicate level)
2. Clause Coverage (clause level)
3. Combinatorial Clause Coverage (the most complete)
4. A collection of criteria based on making each clause **active or inactive**.

#### Q: What are the subsumtion relationships between logic coverage criteria?

#### Q: Relationship between logic coverage criteria and graph coverage criteria?
- Predicate coverage is equivalent to edge coverage

#### Q: Why only n+1 distinct test requirements are needed to satify ACC for a predicate with n clauses?
Intuitively, we might expect 2n test requirements are needed based on ACC definition.
Maybe we can answer this question with a truth table.

#### Q: How to make a clause determine a predicate?
We can use a definitional approach: Pc = P(c=true) XOR P(c=false)
If Pc evaluates to true, then such assignment (of minor clauses) makes clause c determines predicate P (for ACC).
If Pc evaluates to false, then such assignment makes c does not determine p (for ICC).

Note that to use this approach, we need to know how to compute (simplify) expression containing XOR.

#### Q: How to find satisfying values?
