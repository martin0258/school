## 3. Logic Testing 
### 3.2 Logic Expression Coverage Criteria 

### Question
#### Q: What are the development of logic coverage criteria?
1. Predicate Coverage (predicate level)
2. Clause Coverage (clause level)
3. Combinatorial Clause Coverage (the most complete)
4. A collection of criteria based on making each clause **active or inactive**.

#### Q: What are the subsumtion relationships between logic coverage criteria?

#### Q: Relationship between logic coverage criteria and graph coverage criteria?
- Predicate coverage is equivalent to edge coverage

#### Q: Why only n+1 distinct test requirements are needed to satify ACC for a predicate with n clauses?
Intuitively, we might expect 2n test requirements are needed based on ACC definition.
Maybe we can answer this question with a truth table.
