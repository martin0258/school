# Big Data Application Homework 1

### MapReduce
1. 
  - **Mapper**: A procedure that receives `a record` and outputs `one or more (key, value) pairs`.
  - **Reducer**: A procedure that receives `a (key, values of the key)` and outputs `one or more (key, value) pairs`.
  - **Combiner**: A procedure that combines output data of mapper at a local machine before sending to shuffler.

### Analytics Overview
1. 
  - **Supervised Learning**: Learning from `labeled data` only.
  - **Unsupervised Learning**: Learning from `unlabeled data` only.
  - **Semi-supervised Learning**: Learning from both labeled (usually little) and unlabeled data.
2. Because the outcome of tossing a coin is random (assume it is a fair coin).

### Clustering
